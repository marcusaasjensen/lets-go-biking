# Lets Go Biking! üö≤
School project designed to provide a convenient itinerary for cyclists traveling between two addresses with an integrated map.

The application functions as a self-hosted SOAP server on the server side, accompanied by a robust Java-based heavy client. Utilizing WCF servers, the app communicates through REST APIs and a routing service with proxy and cache, connecting seamlessly with providers like JCDecaux, Open Route Service, and Nominatim.

## Example üíª
Enter valid source and destination addresses, the app will find the nearest JCDecaux stations for you to get a bicycle. The app will then show you all the steps you have to make, from walking to the station, get a bike, travel to the next station, and arrive at your finale destination. If taking a bicycle is too long, the app will show you the shortest itinerary by walking.

Here is the app interface on the command prompt.
```
Welcome to... Lets Go Biking!

Enter origin (type 'q' to quit): paris
Enter destination: madrid
...
```
When you enter the origin and the destination, you will get the entire itinerary on the command prompt (walking and cycling steps) with all the specifications about duration and distance.

You can save your itinerary in a text file.

A map opens up for you to visualize the itinerary and each small steps.
